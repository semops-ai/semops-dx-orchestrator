- name: Translation Rules
 description: Rules for transforming internal documentation into public-facing content.
 rules:
 - id: capabilities-not-commands
 summary: Describe what happens and why, not how to invoke it.
 before: Run /research to trigger the RAG-powered research agent
 after: The research step queries the knowledge base to gather first-party source material
 - id: neutral-infra-not-tools
 summary: Lead with the infrastructure role, name your choice, then acknowledge alternatives.
 before: Port 6333 for Qdrant REST, 7687 for Neo4j Bolt
 after: A vector database (Qdrant; Weaviate and Milvus serve the same role)
 - id: patterns-not-paths
 summary: Describe the pattern and why it works, not the file conventions.
 before: Session notes go in docs/session-notes/ISSUE-NN-description.md
 after: Development work is tracked through session notes -- append-only logs organized by GitHub issue
 - id: decisions-not-defaults
 summary: State the choice, the reasoning, and the alternatives.
 before: Use uv for package management
 after: Python repos use uv -- chosen for speed in AI-assisted workflows. Poetry or pip-tools are alternatives
 - id: boundaries-not-internals
 summary: Explain why the boundary exists, not just where it is.
 before: This repo owns content creation. Core owns knowledge.
 after: Each repo has a clear ownership boundary. Publisher handles content creation. The knowledge
 graph and shared services live in Core.
 - id: honest-maturity
 summary: Never present in-progress work as complete.
 before: Feature is 80% implemented with known gaps
 after: 'This component is functional but evolving. Current limitations: ...'
- name: Distilled Editorial Rules
 description: Heuristics discovered through human-in-the-loop editing across multiple repos.
 rules:
 - id: rule-001
 statement: When a term comes from a specific discipline (DDD, systems theory, information theory),
 replace it with a plain-language equivalent that conveys the same concept. Reserve the technical
 term for documents targeting that discipline's audience.
 scope: style-specific
 styles:
 - technical
 - id: rule-002
 statement: When a paragraph contains three or more distinct points, restructure as a lead sentence
 followed by bold-phrase bullet list. Each bullet should be scannable independently.
 scope: style-specific
 styles:
 - technical
 - id: rule-003
 statement: Scope claims to the framework or domain they belong to. General concepts should be framed
 within the specific system context; narrow framing should be broadened when the concept applies
 more widely.
 scope: global
 styles:
 - technical
 - id: rule-004
 statement: When content is stated in two places, keep the version that carries more context or is
 better positioned for the reader. Remove the duplicate entirely or absorb it into the stronger location.
 scope: style-specific
 styles:
 - technical
 - id: rule-005
 statement: Frame outcomes as conditional properties of the system, not promises to the reader. Replace
 'you will' / 'you create' with 'when X, then Y' or 'X enables Y'. Remove blockquotes that read as
 taglines.
 scope: style-specific
 styles:
 - technical
 - whitepaper
 - id: rule-006
 statement: Expand acronyms and domain-specific nomenclature on first use with a short parenthetical.
 Definitions should be self-contained — avoid defining a concept using other framework-specific terms
 the reader hasn't encountered yet.
 scope: global
 styles:
 - technical
 - blog
 - whitepaper
 - id: rule-007
 statement: Do not number section headers (H2, H3, etc.) in body content. Use descriptive headings
 only.
 scope: style-specific
 styles:
 - technical
 - id: rule-008
 statement: When referencing another framework document, link it and include a brief description of
 what the reader will find there. Keep cross-document terminology consistent — changes in one doc
 should be mirrored in documents that reference it.
 scope: global
 styles:
 - technical
 - blog
 - id: rule-009
 statement: 'Distinguish AI''s role precisely: AI identifies, encodes, and integrates upfront; downstream
 execution is deterministic. AI re-engages for interpretation and iteration. Do not frame AI as ''implementing''
 — it assists human decision-making.'
 scope: global
 styles:
 - technical
 - blog
 - id: rule-010
 statement: When a document presents multiple frameworks or concepts, include an explicit synthesis
 section that combines them and stands alone as a complete explanation. Don't rely on the reader
 to infer the connection.
 scope: global
 styles:
 - technical
 - id: rule-011
 statement: Avoid dramatic short-sentence style (staccato fragments, standalone reveal lines, 'you've
 probably had the moment' openers). Embed lists and key points in flowing prose rather than using
 a slide-deck rhythm.
 scope: style-specific
 styles:
 - marketing-narrative
 - id: rule-012
 statement: 'Use founder voice in marketing-narrative content: first-person ''I think'', ''I maintain''
 for credibility; opportunity tone rather than blame; soften hard claims while maintaining conviction.'
 scope: style-specific
 styles:
 - marketing-narrative
 - id: rule-013
 statement: 'Use consistent DIKW terminology: ''levels'' for D positions, ''hierarchy'' for the overall
 structure, ''transformation'' for the process between levels. Avoid ''stages'' (implies temporal
 sequence).'
 scope: global
 styles:
 - marketing-narrative
 - technical
 - id: rule-014
 statement: Prefer positive, actionable framing over negative definitions. Instead of 'X is not Y',
 state what X enables. Acknowledge difficulty while maintaining grounded optimism.
 scope: style-specific
 styles:
 - marketing-narrative
 - id: rule-015
 statement: 'Don''t introduce framework concepts or terminology before the reader has enough context
 to understand them. Build in order: establish observable reality, introduce the concept, then use
 the framework term. Reserve terms for the section where they''re earned.'
 scope: global
 styles:
 - marketing-narrative
 - technical
 - id: rule-016
 statement: When introducing framework components or concepts, show what work looks like through the
 model's lens — not what goes wrong. Use operational examples (what people do) rather than failure
 examples (what breaks).
 scope: style-specific
 styles:
 - marketing-narrative
 - id: rule-017
 statement: Don't label observations as 'the key insight' or 'the critical point.' Don't claim ownership
 of 3P concepts — use 'I use' not 'I built' for established frameworks. Scope claims to what is actually
 original. Frame as reasoning process, not universal truth.
 scope: global
 styles:
 - marketing-narrative
 - technical
 - id: rule-018
 statement: In marketing-narrative content, use first person (founder voice) and third person (organizations).
 Do not address the reader directly with 'you' or 'your' — reframe with impersonal constructions
 or third person.
 scope: style-specific
 styles:
 - marketing-narrative
 - id: rule-019
 statement: Don't hypothesize what the document has already established. When the author has built
 an argument earlier in the text, use consequential framing ('because X') rather than conditional
 framing ('if X'). The document's own logic is not hypothetical to itself.
