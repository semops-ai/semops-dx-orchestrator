 description: Every project gets a scope definition with outcome, acceptance criteria, and execution
 sequence. Specs are the contract between coordination and implementation.
 structure:
 - section: outcome
 purpose: What done looks like
 - section: acceptance_criteria
 purpose: Measurable conditions
 - section: execution_sequence
 purpose: Ordered steps with dependencies
 - section: child_issues
 purpose: Work items in owning repos
 - section: dependencies
 purpose: External blockers
 workflow: GitHub Project created -> spec written from template -> issues created in owning repos ->
 work tracked via project board -> spec updated as scope evolves -> project closed when done.
