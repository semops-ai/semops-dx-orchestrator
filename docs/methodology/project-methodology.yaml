methodology:
  name: Project Spec Pattern
  description: >
    Every project gets a scope definition with outcome, acceptance criteria,
    and execution sequence. Specs are the contract between coordination
    and implementation.
  structure:
    - section: Outcome
      description: What "done" looks like in 1-2 sentences
    - section: Acceptance Criteria
      description: Concrete, verifiable conditions — project is complete when ALL are true
    - section: Execution Sequence
      description: >
        Ordered plan of work. Each step lists what must be done first
        and what it unblocks. Steps at the same number can run concurrently.
    - section: Child Issues
      description: >
        Implementation issues live in the repo where code changes happen.
        The orchestrator holds only the coordination issue and spec.
    - section: Dependencies
      description: External dependencies outside this project's control
    - section: References
      description: Links to ADRs, related projects, and key documentation
  commands:
    - name: project-create
      description: Create a new project spec from template and GitHub Project board
    - name: project-review
      description: Review project status, update spec, and reconcile with board
  workflow: >
    GitHub Project created -> spec written from template ->
    issues created in owning repos -> work tracked via project board ->
    spec updated as scope evolves -> project closed when done.
  rules:
    - Orchestrator issues are coordination/spec only — never implementation
    - Implementation issues live in the repo where code changes happen
    - Acceptance criteria must be verifiable — no subjective measures
    - Update child issue table as issues are created, moved, or completed
    - If execution sequence needs to change, update the spec and note the reason
    - Mark status Complete when all acceptance criteria are met
  relationships:
    - artifact: ADRs
      role: "Decisions — they explain WHY. A spec references ADRs but is not one."
    - artifact: Session Notes
      role: "Work logs — they capture WHAT HAPPENED during implementation."
    - artifact: Project Specs
      role: "Scope definitions — they define WHAT DONE MEANS."

    title: Corpus Creation and Query
    status: active
    scope: >
      Populated knowledge base with query API for agents to get precise
      context about patterns, repos, and architectures.

  - id: 14
    title: Public Repos Publishing
    status: active
    scope: >
      Sanitized, properly documented public repos under semops-ai org
      ready for external audiences.

  - id: 15
    title: Open Source Agentic Lineage
    status: draft
    scope: >
      Published Python package demonstrating agent provenance tracking;
      public extraction using bounded context extraction pattern.

  - id: 18
    title: Semantic Coherence Measurement
    status: draft
    scope: >
      Automated measurement of semantic coherence with corpus-level scores,
      document drift detection, and MLflow experiment tracking.

  - id: 19
    title: DX Hub Orchestration and Autonomy v1
    status: complete
    scope: >
      Full orchestration for multi-repo ecosystem: project awareness,
      update delivery, cross-repo sync, and autonomous agent execution.

  - id: 24
    title: Research Corpus v1
    status: draft
    scope: >
      Complete research capability: capture third-party content, ingest,
      synthesize insights, promote discoveries, and measure coherence.

  - id: 25
    title: Scale Projection
    status: draft
    scope: >
      Validated pattern for testing domain coherence by projecting
      architecture to scaled deployment; delta should be infrastructure only.

    title: Bounded Context Extraction
    status: active
    scope: >
      Formalized extraction pattern for extracting bounded contexts
      into standalone repositories with proper documentation.

    title: Forgejo Migration
    status: active
    scope: >
      Self-hosted Forgejo instance on Tailscale mesh proven viable for
      agent-first workflows; at least one private repo migrated.

  - id: 29
    title: DX Hub Automation and Infrastructure
    status: active
    scope: >
      Live infrastructure visibility and autonomous agent execution
      via GitHub Actions (remaining orchestration capabilities).
