## Adoption Context

- **Original Capability:** `orchestration` — shared tooling and cross-system observability
- **Problem Statement:** Multi-service systems need orchestration beyond individual repo concerns — dependency management, cross-system data flows, operational intelligence across the whole platform.
- **Selection Criteria:** Platform engineering pattern — shared tooling, self-service capabilities, cross-system observability. Foundation for `explicit-enterprise` which extends platform engineering with human+AI collaboration.
- **ADR:** —
