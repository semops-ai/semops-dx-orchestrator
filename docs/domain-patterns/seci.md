## Adoption Context

- **Original Capability:** `style-learning` — knowledge creation model for tacit-to-explicit conversion
- **Problem Statement:** Human expertise (style, judgment, taste) is tacit knowledge that resists direct encoding. Need a model for systematically converting tacit knowledge to explicit, capturable rules.
- **Selection Criteria:** Nonaka's SECI model (1994) — Socialization, Externalization, Combination, Internalization. Applied to style capture: human editorial knowledge (tacit) is externalized into structured rules that agents can apply.
